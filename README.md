# Home assignment - Tomato allergies

The objective of this repo is to create a deep learning model to classifiy images with tomatoes. The model I used for this task is a faster rcnn with a resnet 50 backbone. The idea is to exploit the existence of boundary bounding boxes detecting aliments for a better classification. The implementation was done in the Pytorch framework. In this repo you can also find a notebook (in html and ipynb) to visualize the training details and run the model.
