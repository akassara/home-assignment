# Home assignment - Tomato allergies

The objective of this repo is to create a deep learning model to classifiy images with tomatoes. The I used for this task is a faster rcnn with a resnet 50 backbone. The idea is to exploit the existence of boundary bounding boxes detecting aliments for a better classification. The implementation was done in the Pytorch framework.
